      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> Fallout 4 may be one of my longest played games ever and for good reason, the sheer amount of content on offer is phenomenal,the open world map is huge with
hundreds of quests to undertake for the plethora of characters you will meet over the course of the game.  </p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>  

Anyone who's played any of the previous Fallout Games will know the general premise, like in Fallout 3, the player needs to find a missing family member, this time, their son.
The player can once again create their own fully customisable character, male or female, unlike the old Fallout games, the player character also speaks, this however means you won't
get to see exactly what you're going to make the player say when talking to other chracters, the fact there is only one voice for each gender is disappointing though, even Saints Row 
had multiple voices!

      <h2>Gameplay continued



      </h2>
      <p>
The main thing you're going to be doing is engaging in armed combat with the many mutated creatures and robots dotted around the open world, thankfully weapons don't
deteriorate and need repair like they did in Fallout 3, we also see a return of the V.A.T.S precision targeting system which is always helpful wih small or fast enemies. 
the player can once again unlock perks or improve their basic stats whenever they level up, this can be from simply upping strength or making it harder to get addicted to alcohol (yes that's a thing in this game)
