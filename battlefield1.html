      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> Battlefield 1 is a unique speciman, while there's been an overabundance of World War 2 shooters over the years <br>
      this game is set in the First World War, something relatively unheard of, most people don't know exactly World War 1 even happened, I'd played games set
      in the American Civil War before I'd played a World War 1 game  </p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      
      
      <p>
        While I haven't delved into the single player campaign too much, The Multiplayer is where the game really shines, it follows the usual Battlefield premise,
        you play as various factions of a war in one of several game modes (conqeust, team deathmatch etc.) Surprisingly, France and Russia don't feature here, but Austria-Hungary and
         Italy do, the variety of weapons is rather lacklustre compared to the other games as well but this might be to preserve historical accuracy.

      <h2> Gameplay continued   </h2>

         <p> A bit more slow-paced than the other big shooters like Call of Duty or Halo, Battlefield focuses more on strategy and teamwork, this isn't 
        a run and gun game, although blasting away with the rocket launchers can be effective.
        There are 4 classes with their own weapon types and equipment, Assault (Sub Machine Guns, shotguns) Medic( Rifles, Health boosts, explosives ) Support( Large Machine Guns)
        and Scout (Snipers)
         </p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>
A good move forward for the series, the season pass system that EA loves still annoys me somewhat and the lack of weapon variety lets it down slightly.
