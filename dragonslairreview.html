      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> Where to start with this one, this particular game takes "difficult" to an entirely new level, 
in short, it would be easier to get Donald Trump to write a Tweet with a modicum of intelligence than to
complete  this game (Without cheating, of course) The notoriously incredible difficulty of this game has given
it something akin to a cult following. It genuinely feels nothing short of a miracle that this game passed quality control back in 1990 </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>  Like in the Mega Man series, you are presented with a stage select menu, <br>
    so you are able to explore more than one level of the game at least, there are 5 stages with multiple sections <br>
    with a boss at the end of each stage, plus one final stage after completing all five sections, <br>
    the major problem, however, is that it's almost impossible to complete even one section of a stage <br>
  (I managed to complete a total one section without cheating) You get a grand total of one hit point, <br>
   yes, you read that right, if you are hit once, you die and lose a life, and the fun doesn't stop there, <br>
    it's not just the enemies and their projectiles you have to avoid being hit by, just so much as <br>
     touching the wrong part of the scenery can kill the almighty Silver Surfer. <br>
     There are two types of levels, the side scrollers and the overhead levels, the overhead levels <br>
     are undeniably the more difficult of the two, as the movement of silver surfer feels more rigid and it's <br>
     much harder to determine which parts of the scenery you can touch without dying. <br></p>

      <h2>Verdict</h2>
      <p>Whilst I can appreciate games in the late 80s and early 90s were more challenging to compensate <br>
         for relatively short overall length and smaller amount of content, but this game took it way too far <br>
         when it's near impossible to even complete even one level, you know something has gone seriously wrong. <br>
         The relentless difficulty harms the overall verdict severely, but the funky music and cool graphics earn it a point.</p>
