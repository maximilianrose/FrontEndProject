      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Going into this I was apprehensive at first, as most games based on TV shows are shameless cash grabs and are normally mediocre at best, the old South Park 
        games of the late 90s were appalling, but this is one they've got right.
          
           The game is a hilarious take on the now the turned-based RPG, you create your own character who is 
          the newest resident of South Park, who then teams up with with the other kids of South Park to fulfill epic quests,</p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>

      <p>
          Outside of battles you can freely explore the open world of South Park in a 2.5D perspective, there are some puzzles to solve, but the main premise of the game is the 
          battles, you can use physical attacks and even "magic" (which are just farts). The Highlight of the game is definitely the fight with Al Gore and his alter-ego, the Manbearpig.
